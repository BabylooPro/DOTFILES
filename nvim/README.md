# MY NEOVIM CONFIGURATION

As a newcomer to the world of Neovimers, _here‚Äôs my personal setup_. So I wanted some an IDE with extreme minimalism, without any mouse interaction, just pure keyboard magic, so I chose Neovim.

Former VSCode user (and unfortunately still occasional for reasons of simplicity), I had overkilled my VSCode to be as ultra-minimalist as possible with extensions. But I got fed up with Microsoft‚Äôs endless updates constantly breaking my setup and messing things up 24/7‚Ä¶ so I switched to Neovim :D

> üìù **Note:** This configuration is a work in progress as I continue to learn Neovim. Expect frequent updates and improvements as I discover new tricks and optimizations.
